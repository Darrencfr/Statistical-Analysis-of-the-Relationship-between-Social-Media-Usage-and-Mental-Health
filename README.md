Description:
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to understand factors influencing sleep efficiency. Using a dataset with variables like age, gender, sleep duration, caffeine/alcohol consumption, and exercise frequency, I performed data cleaning, EDA, and built a multiple linear regression model.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
I handled missing values using mean or median imputation based on skewness. Outliers were treated using IQR-based capping and median replacement. Categorical variables were converted into factors, and datetime fields were transformed for better usability.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I visualized variable distributions using histograms and boxplots to identify patterns and anomalies. Scatter plots and correlation tests explored relationships between predictors and sleep efficiency. Normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk) and correlation analyses assessed variable associations, providing insights into the dataâ€™s characteristics.

Predictive Modeling:
A multiple linear regression model was built to predict sleep efficiency based on demographic, lifestyle, and sleep-related factors. Multicollinearity among predictors was evaluated using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to ensure robust model performance.

Key Findings:
Significant predictors of sleep efficiency included deep sleep percentage, exercise frequency, and alcohol consumption. Insights revealed the negative impact of alcohol and the positive effect of regular exercise on sleep quality, highlighting the importance of lifestyle choices in improving sleep hygiene.

Impact and Learning:
This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling. It demonstrated how data-driven approaches uncover meaningful patterns and drive decision-making in health and wellness, offering actionable recommendations for better sleep efficiency.
